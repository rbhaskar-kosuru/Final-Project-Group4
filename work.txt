Project Proposal (Draft)
Project Title
Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Electronics Reviews using LSTM and Naive Bayes Models

Problem Selection
We selected the problem of sentiment analysis on Amazon Electronics reviews because customer reviews influence purchasing behavior, and understanding sentiment can help companies improve products and services. We focus on Electronics because it is one of Amazon's largest and most review-rich categories, allowing robust model training and evaluation.

Dataset
We will use the Amazon 2023 Reviews Dataset, specifically the Electronics subset (link).
The dataset contains millions of product reviews, each with metadata including the review text and a star rating (1 to 5 stars).

We will convert star ratings into sentiment labels:

1–2 stars → Negative

3 stars → Neutral

4–5 stars → Positive

NLP Methods
We will use two approaches:

Baseline Model: Naive Bayes classifier (Rule-Based Model) using TF-IDF features.

Advanced Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network (Recurrent Neural Network) with pretrained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe or FastText).

Packages
Scikit-learn: For classical ML model (Naive Bayes), metrics, and preprocessing.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.

NLTK / SpaCy: For basic text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal).

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualization of model performance.

NLP Tasks
Sentiment classification: Map review texts to Positive, Negative, or Neutral classes.
