## Overview of the Project:

Sentiment analysis is the computational process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text to determine whether the authorâ€™s attitude toward a particular product is positive, negative, or neutral. This is especially crucial for industry leaders like Amazon, whose vast e-commerce operations depend on understanding consumer behavior and sentiment to engage more effectively with their customers. With recent advancements in machine learning and text analytics, this can now be achieved with high accuracy. In this project, we aim to predict the sentiment or polarity of reviews for Amazon baby products using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will compare the performance of various approaches and identify the most effective method for this application.
